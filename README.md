# Minerva-2019-2020
Girls In Tech 2019 Technovation submission. Mobile App created using Xcode to address the challenges faced by female identifying and nonbinary students.


I am not sure if this project will run smoothly on the first simulation. If it does not, here are some touble shooting ideas as to what went wrong.

- the pods/ dependances have to be installed (your propably familar with cocoapods and pod init, so maybe reinstall/ update them in the terminal)
- the file has a firebase connection. My trial expired so the inital data serve is now closed. Makeing a new data firebase store isn't too complicated (I'm guessing your also familiar with firestore since you problibly need it for your user authentication, so cool that your doing the user authentication by the way<3). Just don't forget to update the info.list thing.
- there are errors in my code (highly likely, also buttons mights have to be reimplemented into the different files, though I'm not sure) 

That's all I have. If you went though these and the project is still relentlessly crashing or my code doesn't make sense we can always chat ;)
